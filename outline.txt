1.Basic Linear static 2D membrane analysis
		Simple geometry input
		Materials
		Point restrains
		Point Load
		Solve
		Show deformation
		
2.Add SIMP method to it
		strain history graph
		animate history

3.Extend to linear static 3D analysis
		Bending formulation
		
4.Increase restraints and loading
		line
		surface

5.Stress results
		components and VM
		
6.Maybe extend to dynamics?
